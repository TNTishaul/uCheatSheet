## Why?
Me and my fiance are both Gm's at U-Haul and we stumbled across this repo, our interest was immediately peaked. 
A website that a CSR can go to for quick references was missing from their workflow. 

One time or another, every CSR has to go to our .com instead of .net to gather information for the customer. 
ESL's Vue SPO is good, but performance is lacking. Therefore I wanted to take this existing repo and modernize it.

### Plans
- Replace Jquery with HTMX and GoLang
- Allow for easier forking and running one's own website
- ???
