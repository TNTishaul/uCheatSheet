## Why?
One time or another, every CSR has to go to our .com instead of .net to gather information for the customer.

Me and my fiance are both Gm's at U-Haul and we stumbled across this repo, our interest was immediately peaked. 
A website that a CSR can go to for quick references was missing from their workflow. 

 
ESL's Vue SPO is good, but performance is lacking. 
Its about time our CSRs have a snappy and informative tool to help serve customers.
### Plans
- Replace Jquery with HTMX and GoLang
- Allow for easier forking and running one's own website
